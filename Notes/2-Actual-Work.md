Right now, the screen backlight is always on, and the screen is always drawn.

Change the code to turn the screen backlight off and make the screen blank when the
screen has not been touched for a 30 seconds. Turn the screen backlight on and draw the
screen when the screen is touched, but don't activate any buttons until the screen has
been touched for a second time.
